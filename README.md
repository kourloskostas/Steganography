# Steganography

This project implements Image/Audio/Video steganography using Spatial Domain (LSB).

I quote Harpreet Kaur and Jyoti Rani 1 :
"A Steganography is the science or art of hide the messages into other sources of information like text/documents, audios, videos and images etc.
so that it is not visible to unauthorized users. It is known as invisible communication. A Steganography system madeup of three components: cover-object means which hides
the secret message, the secret message and the stegoobject means which is the cover object with message embedded inside it. Video consist of collection of image.
A digital image is represented by using a 2-D matrix of the color intestines at each grid points. The gray images use 8 bits, whereas colored utilizes 24 bits to describe the
color model, such as RGB model. The different types of techniques are used in the Steganography is to hide the messages in the cover images. These techniques provide
the best challenge for digital forensics investigations. Before transmission the message is encrypted and with the help of a key, the message is decrypted at receiver
side. Nobody can describe the content of the key except one having the key. The message is known as the plain text and message in the encrypted form is known as the
cipher text. At the time of transmission the message is protected. After decryption, the message becomes Unprotected and it can be copied and distributed. The
Secret or encrypted message may be a text file, a cipher text, audio or images [1]. Applications for a data-hiding scheme include inband captioning, communication conversion, image
tamper Proofing, revision tracking, enhance robustness of image search engines and smart Ids or identity cards where individual's details are embedded in their photographs. "
